## Known areas of concern

- Sharing secrets! - I've included the `.env` in this repo, which includes the timezone API key. This is only for your convience and would never be allowed in a real application.
- No tests - Given the time constraint, and the nature of the test I didn't feel tests were relevant.
- No styling - Same with the tests, I wanted to spend my time on how the app functioned, and how the code was organized, over how it is styled.
